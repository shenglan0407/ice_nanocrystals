# ice_nanocrystals

I will use this repo to document ice nano_crystal simulations

# What's going right now
- running a simulation at q=2.086, 1 per shot, 10000 shots. 
- ice model is II from ice_models/3.cif 

# TO-DO
- make more crystals
- test script for using thor: many oritations, 1 shot, find bragg rings
- GPU code?
