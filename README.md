# ice_nanocrystals

I will use this repo to document ice nano_crystal simulations

#wha's going right now
- running a simulation at q=1.61, 512 per shot, 500 shots. CUDA should have kicked in. 
# TO-DO
- make more crystals
- test script for using thor: many oritations, 1 shot, find bragg rings
- GPU code?
